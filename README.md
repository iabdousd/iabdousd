Hey! My name is Abderrahmane, and you can call me Abdou.<br>
I'm a Full Stack developer working as a Freelancer.

Currently i've been working with many different technologies, front-end and back-end, low and high platform, each one focusing an different goal purpose.


A beautiful and intuitive user interface is just as important as well coded software.

No matter what the languages or frameworks you've thrown at me. I will get the job done!


And i love to create algorithms and heuristics!
