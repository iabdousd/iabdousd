Hi there! My name is Abderrahmane, but you can call me Abdou. I'm a Full Stack developer and a Freelancer. I have a diverse skillset and have worked with a wide range of technologies, both on the front-end and back-end, and at various levels of abstraction.

I believe that a well-designed user interface is just as important as efficient and reliable code. I thrive in problem-solving situations and enjoy tackling challenges head-on, no matter the language or framework.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a passion for creating algorithms and heuristics. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. Let's work together and bring your project to life!
