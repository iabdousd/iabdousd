Hi there! I'm Abdou â€“ Founder at Software Savants and a seasoned software engineer with 6+ years of experience. I build scalable, high-performance apps by fusing AI (LLMs, Vector DBs, RAG), mobile & web development, and intuitive product design. I've partnered with over 50 founders to turn bold ideas into rapid, transformative solutions. Open-source contributions, innovative projects, and collaborations welcome.
